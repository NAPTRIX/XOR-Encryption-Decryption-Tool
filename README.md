### XOR Encryption/Decryption Tool

This Python script provides a simple command-line tool for XOR encryption and decryption. XOR encryption is a basic form of encryption that uses the XOR (exclusive or) operation to transform plaintext data into ciphertext. This tool allows you to:

- Encrypt plaintext with a key.
- Decrypt ciphertext using the same key.
- The tool encloses the ciphertext in double quotes for easy copying and pasting.

### Important Notes:

1. XOR encryption is not suitable for secure encryption of sensitive data; use strong encryption algorithms for such purposes.
2. Ensure that you provide the correct key for decryption.
3. Take care when copying and pasting ciphertext, as leading/trailing spaces can affect decryption.
